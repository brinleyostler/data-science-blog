<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">E</span>xploratory Data Analysis (or EDA) is the key that unlocks a dataset for our use. When you first receive a dataset, you may be stuck and have no idea how to proceed. This is where Exploratory Data Analysis comes in handy! This post will walk through the basics of EDA in R.</p>


## What should I do first?
The very first thing you should do when receiving a new set of data is plot it!
1. Identify your response variable and your explanatory variables.
2. Determine whether they are quantitative or categorical.
3. Create a plot, chart, or graph that puts the response variable on the y-axis and your chosen explanatory variable(s) on the x-axis.

*This is not an extensive list, but it includes the basic plots that weâ€™ll explore!*


### Categorical Response, Categorical Explanatory
* Bar plot
* Stacked bar plot

### Categorical Response, Quantitative Explanatory
* Box plot
* Histogram

### Quantitative Response, Categorical Explanatory
* Box plot
* Bar plot for means

### Quantitative Response, Quantitative Explanatory
* Scatter plot
* Scatter plot with regression line

## Table

| Response Variable      | Explanatory Variable | Type of Plot |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| Categorical            | Categorical          | Bar plot, Stacked bar plot       |
| Categorical            | Quantitative         | Box plot, Histogram       |
| Quantitative           | Catiegorical         | Box plot, Bar plot for means       |
| Quantitative           | Quantitative         | Scatter plot, Scatter plot with regression line       |
