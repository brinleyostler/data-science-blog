## What should I do first?
One of the very first steps of every Explanatory Data Analysis is to plot the data! Visualizing your data helps you understand its structure and uncover patterns. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get you started:
1. **Identify Your Variables:** Determine which variables in your dataset are the response variable (the outcome you are interested in) and which are explanatory variables (the variables you think might explain changes in the response variable).
2. **Categorize Your Variables:** Check whether these variables are quantitative (numeric) or categorical (qualitative).
3. **Create Initial Plots:** Plot your data to get an overview. Place the response variable on the y-axis and the explanatory variable(s) on the x-axis.

*This is not an exhaustive list, but it covers some basic plots that are essential for EDA.*


## Plot Types
Based on your variables' data types, you'll want to use different types of plots. 

| Response Variable        | Explanatory Variable     | Type of Plot |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------ |
| Categorical              | Categorical              | Bar plot, Stacked bar plot       |
| Categorical              | Quantitative             | Box plot, Histogram       |
| Quantitative             | Categorical              | Box plot, Bar plot for means       |
| Quantitative             | Quantitative             | Scatter plot, Scatter plot with regression line       |


## Spicing Up Your Plots
### Scatterplots
#### Quantiative Response, Quantitative Explanatory
To demonstrate the scatter plot, we will use the "mtcars" dataset that comes with R. We'll start with a basic scatterplot, and I'll take you through four different ways you can update your code to create more dynamic plots.

*The Motor Trend Car Road Tests dataset (or mtcars) dataset comes from data that was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models).*

1. Load the necessary ggplot library, and pull in the mtcars dataset for our use.
```r
# Load library and mtcars dataset
library(ggplot2)
data("mtcars")
```

2. Select an explanatory and response variable (make sure both are numerical!)
```r
# This will output the first 10 lines of the dataset
head(mtcars)
```
