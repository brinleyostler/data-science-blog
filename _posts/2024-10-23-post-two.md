#### Project Motivation
In this project, I set out to analyze a dataset of the top books (and audiobooks) from my local library. My goal was to uncover patterns with the most popular titles, authors, and formats. 
* Which books are most popular?
* What is the average wait time for popular books?
* Does a book's popularity (ranking) relate to the number of copies available?
To answer these questions, I used web-scraping techniques in Python, specifically leveraging Selenium and XPath, to gather this data from my hometown libraryâ€™s digital database.

#### Quick note on webscraping practices:
Whenever we as data scientists want to scrape some data from the web, we have to ensure we are following best practice. Check that site's robots.txt file (accessible at the base url/robots.txt). Good scraping practice ensures we are using delay functions in our, only scraping necessary data, and not accessing sensitive or restricted information.
