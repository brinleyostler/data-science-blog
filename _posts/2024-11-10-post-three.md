<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span> know the burning question that lingers in your mind is what Arizona's most popular books are, so I did the work for you. Let's get into it!</p>

#### In case you missed it...
Check out my [last post](https://brinleyostler.github.io/data-science-blog/blog/post-two/) for code on how I collected this data!

## Burning Questions

### 1) Are the most popular books even any good?

These books are ranked based on how popular they are, not how highly rated they are. In order for a book to be popular, it means a lot of people are borrowing it and reading it. But are the books even any good?
